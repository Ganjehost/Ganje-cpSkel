**Ganje Host cPanel Skeleton Directory Files**

Welcome to the official repository for Ganje Host's cPanel skeleton directory. This repository contains files that can be used as templates for newly created user accounts on a cPanel server. By placing these files in the skeleton directory, all new accounts will automatically inherit these files in their `public_html` folder.

## üìÑ Overview

The cPanel skeleton directory (`/root/cpanel3-skel/`) allows hosting providers to define default files and folders that are automatically included in new cPanel accounts when they are created. This is useful for setting up a default web page or providing important resources such as readme files, terms of service, or other essential assets.

In this repository, the `public_html` folder contains the files that will be copied to the `public_html` directory of new cPanel users by default.
